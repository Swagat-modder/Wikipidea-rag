Reinforcement learning is one of the three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\nReinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input-output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead, the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the cumulative reward (the feedback of which might be incomplete or delayed). The search for this balance is known as the exploration\u2013exploitation dilemma.\n\nThe environment is typically stated in the form of a Markov decision process (MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. The main difference between classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the Markov decision process, and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible. \n\n\n== Principles ==\nDue to its generality, reinforcement learning is studied in many disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, and statistics. In the operations research and control literature, RL is called approximate dynamic programming, or neuro-dynamic programming. The problems of interest in RL have also been studied in the theory of optimal control, which is concerned mostly with the existence and characterization of optimal solutions, and algorithms for their exact computation, and less with learning or approximation (particularly in the absence of a mathematical model of the environment).\nBasic reinforcement learning is modeled as a Markov decision process:\n\nA set of environment and agent states (the state space), \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            S\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {S}}}\n  \n;\nA set of actions (the action space), \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n  \n, of the agent;\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            a\n          \n        \n        (\n        s\n        ,\n        \n          s\n          \u2032\n        \n        )\n        =\n        Pr\n        (\n        \n          S\n          \n            t\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          s\n          \u2032\n        \n        \u2223\n        \n          S\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        =\n        s\n        ,\n        \n          A\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        =\n        a\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{a}(s,s')=\\Pr(S_{t+1}=s'\\mid S_{t}=s,A_{t}=a)}\n  \n, the transition probability (at time \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n) from state \n  \n    \n      \n        s\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s}\n  \n to state \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          s\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s'}\n  \n under action \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            a\n          \n        \n        (\n        s\n        ,\n        \n          s\n          \u2032\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R_{a}(s,s')}\n  \n, the immediate reward after transition from \n  \n    \n      \n        s\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          s\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s'}\n  \n under action \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n.\nThe purpose of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an optimal (or near-optimal) policy that maximizes the reward function or other user-provided reinforcement signal that accumulates from immediate rewards.

If the agent only has access to a subset of states, or if the observed states are corrupted by noise, the agent is said to have partial observability, and formally the problem must be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process. In both cases, the set of actions available to the agent can be restricted. For example, the state of an account balance could be restricted to be positive; if the current value of the state is 3 and the state transition attempts to reduce the value by 4, the transition will not be allowed.\nWhen the agent's performance is compared to that of an agent that acts optimally, the difference in performance yields the notion of regret. In order to act near optimally, the agent must reason about long-term consequences of its actions (i.e., maximize future rewards), although the immediate reward associated with this might be negative.\nThus, reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited to problems that include a long-term versus short-term reward trade-off.

A policy is stationary if the action-distribution returned by it depends only on the last state visited (from the observation agent's history). The search can be further restricted to deterministic stationary policies. A deterministic stationary policy deterministically selects actions based on the current state.

Computing these functions involves computing expectations over the whole state-space, which is impractical for all but the smallest (finite) Markov decision processes. In reinforcement learning methods, expectations are approximated by averaging over samples and using function approximation techniques to cope with the need to represent value functions over large state-action spaces.\n\n\n==== Monte Carlo methods ====\nMonte Carlo methods are used to solve reinforcement learning problems by averaging sample returns. Unlike methods that require full knowledge of the environment's dynamics, Monte Carlo methods rely solely on actual or simulated experience\u2014sequences of states, actions, and rewards obtained from interaction with an environment. This makes them applicable in situations where the complete dynamics are unknown. Learning from actual experience does not require prior knowledge of the environment and can still lead to optimal behavior. When using simulated experience, only a model capable of generating sample transitions is required, rather than a full specification of transition probabilities, which is necessary for dynamic programming methods.\nMonte Carlo methods apply to episodic tasks, where experience is divided into episodes that eventually terminate. Policy and value function updates occur only after the completion of an episode, making these methods incremental on an episode-by-episode basis, though not on a step-by-step (online) basis. The term \"Monte Carlo\" generally refers to any method involving random sampling; however, in this context, it specifically refers to methods that compute averages from complete returns, rather than partial returns.\nThese methods function similarly to the bandit algorithms, in which returns are averaged for each state-action pair. The key difference is that actions taken in one state affect the returns of subsequent states within the same episode, making the problem non-stationary. To address this non-stationarity, Monte Carlo methods use the framework of general policy iteration (GPI). While dynamic programming computes value functions using full knowledge of the Markov decision process (MDP), Monte Carlo methods learn these functions through sample returns. The value functions and policies interact similarly to dynamic programming to achieve optimality, first addressing the prediction problem and then extending to policy improvement and control, all based on sampled experience.\n\n\n==== Temporal difference methods ====\n\nThe first problem is corrected by allowing the procedure to change the policy (at some or all states) before the values settle. This too may be problematic as it might prevent convergence. Most current algorithms do this, giving rise to the class of generalized policy iteration algorithms. Many actor-critic methods belong to this category.\nThe second issue can be corrected by allowing trajectories to contribute to any state-action pair in them. This may also help to some extent with the third problem, although a better solution when returns have high variance is Sutton's temporal difference (TD) methods that are based on the recursive Bellman equation. The computation in TD methods can be incremental (when after each transition the memory is changed and the transition is thrown away), or batch (when the transitions are batched and the estimates are computed once based on the batch). Batch methods, such as the least-squares temporal difference method, may use the information in the samples better, while incremental methods are the only choice when batch methods are infeasible due to their high computational or memory complexity. Some methods try to combine the two approaches. Methods based on temporal differences also overcome the fourth issue.\nAnother problem specific to TD comes from their reliance on the recursive Bellman equation. Most TD methods have a so-called \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bb\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n  \n parameter \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        0\n        \u2264\n        \u03bb\n        \u2264\n        1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (0\\leq \\lambda \\leq 1)}\n  \n that can continuously interpolate between Monte Carlo methods that do not rely on the Bellman equations and the basic TD methods that rely entirely on the Bellman equations.

Methods based on ideas from nonparametric statistics (which can be seen to construct their own features) have been explored.\nValue iteration can also be used as a starting point, giving rise to the Q-learning algorithm and its many variants. Including Deep Q-learning methods when a neural network is used to represent Q, with various applications in stochastic search problems.\nThe problem with using action-values is that they may need highly precise estimates of the competing action values that can be hard to obtain when the returns are noisy, though this problem is mitigated to some extent by temporal difference methods. Using the so-called compatible function approximation method compromises generality and efficiency.\n\n\n=== Direct policy search ===\nAn alternative method is to search directly in (some subset of) the policy space, in which case the problem becomes a case of stochastic optimization. The two approaches available are gradient-based and gradient-free methods.\nGradient-based methods (policy gradient methods) start with a mapping from a finite-dimensional (parameter) space to the space of policies: given the parameter vector \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n  \n, let \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c0\n          \n            \u03b8\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi _{\\theta }}\n  \n denote the policy associated to \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n  \n. Defining the performance function by \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \u03c1\n          \n            \n              \u03c0\n              \n                \u03b8\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho (\\theta )=\\rho ^{\\pi _{\\theta }}}\n  \n under mild conditions this function will be differentiable as a function of the parameter vector \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n  \n. If the gradient of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rho }\n  \n was known, one could use gradient ascent. Since an analytic expression for the gradient is not available, only a noisy estimate is available. Such an estimate can be constructed in many ways, giving rise to algorithms such as Williams's REINFORCE method (which is known as the likelihood ratio method in the simulation-based optimization literature).\nA large class of methods avoids relying on gradient information. These include simulated annealing, cross-entropy search or methods of evolutionary computation. Many gradient-free methods can achieve (in theory and in the limit) a global optimum.\nPolicy search methods may converge slowly given noisy data. For example, this happens in episodic problems when the trajectories are long and the variance of the returns is large. Value-function based methods that rely on temporal differences might help in this case. In recent years, actor\u2013critic methods have been proposed and performed well on various problems.\nPolicy search methods have been used in the robotics context. Many policy search methods may get stuck in local optima (as they are based on local search).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 28195, "end_char_idx": 32694, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0563e99b-d344-48b6-8a4b-af91b7eacacd": {"__data__": {"id_": "0563e99b-d344-48b6-8a4b-af91b7eacacd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66294", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04f08270be8f71285ee7b5b465bf6d72c02f01a98d4e3b58d7be5b1d3f9b1a1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "418b5c90-ef34-4395-ba87-94ad7e198a53", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "78e0108bb36602d7e1b5f5dd38a403ee3da5c92b9eace04518cb38cec8282d62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c319218c-c554-4775-a8a5-b69818a53add", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a91233eafe392f76f6b7d2a7fe9fe68be7e8986cbcc689d27d225dbbf51fe526", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Model-based algorithms ===\nFinally, all of the above methods can be combined with algorithms that first learn a model of the Markov decision process, the probability of each next state given an action taken from an existing state. For instance, the Dyna algorithm learns a model from experience, and uses that to provide more modelled transitions for a value function, in addition to the real transitions. Such methods can sometimes be extended to use of non-parametric models, such as when the transitions are simply stored and \"replayed\" to the learning algorithm.\nModel-based methods can be more computationally intensive than model-free approaches, and their utility can be limited by the extent to which the Markov decision process can be learnt.\nThere are other ways to use models than to update a value function. For instance, in model predictive control the model is used to update the behavior directly.\n\n\n== Theory ==\nBoth the asymptotic and finite-sample behaviors of most algorithms are well understood. Algorithms with provably good online performance (addressing the exploration issue) are known.\nEfficient exploration of Markov decision processes is given in Burnetas and Katehakis (1997). Finite-time performance bounds have also appeared for many algorithms, but these bounds are expected to be rather loose and thus more work is needed to better understand the relative advantages and limitations.\nFor incremental algorithms, asymptotic convergence issues have been settled.

In associative reinforcement learning tasks, the learning system interacts in a closed loop with its environment.\n\n\n=== Deep reinforcement learning ===\nThis approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space.

Instead, the reward function is inferred given an observed behavior from an expert. The idea is to mimic observed behavior, which is often optimal or close to optimal. One popular IRL paradigm is named maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MaxEnt IRL). MaxEnt IRL estimates the parameters of a linear model of the reward function by maximizing the entropy of the probability distribution of observed trajectories subject to constraints related to matching expected feature counts. Recently it has been shown that MaxEnt IRL is a particular case of a more general framework named random utility inverse reinforcement learning (RU-IRL). RU-IRL is based on random utility theory and Markov decision processes. While prior IRL approaches assume that the apparent random behavior of an observed agent is due to it following a random policy, RU-IRL assumes that the observed agent follows a deterministic policy but randomness in observed behavior is due to the fact that an observer only has partial access to the features the observed agent uses in decision making. The utility function is modeled as a random variable to account for the ignorance of the observer regarding the features the observed agent actually considers in its utility function.\n\n\n=== Multi-objective reinforcement learning ===\nMulti-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a form of reinforcement learning concerned with conflicting alternatives.

In addition to mitigating risk, the CVaR objective increases robustness to model uncertainties.

It is a system with only one input (situation), and only one output (action, or behavior).\nSelf-reinforcement (self-learning) was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-reinforcement learning, named Crossbar Adaptive Array (CAA). The CAA computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence states.

Reinforcement learning is where an agent take actions in an environment to maximize the accumulation of rewards. This framework is best fit for many NLP tasks, including dialogue generation, text summarization, and machine translation, where the quality of the output depends on optimizing long-term or human-centered goals rather than the prediction of single correct label.\nEarly application of RL in NLP emerged in dialogue systems, where conversation was determined as a series of actions optimized for fluency and coherence. These early attempts, including policy gradient and sequence-level training techniques, laid a foundation for the broader application of reinforcement learning to other areas of NLP.\nA major breakthrough happened with the introduction of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), a method in which human feedbacks are used to train a reward model that guides the RL agent. Unlike traditional rule-based or supervised systems, RLHF allows models to align their behavior with human judgments on complex and subjective tasks. This technique was initially used in the development of InstructGPT, an effective language model trained to follow human instructions and later in ChatGPT which incorporates RLHF for improving output responses and ensuring safety.\nMore recently, researchers have explored the use of offline RL in NLP to improve dialogue systems without the need of live human interaction. These methods optimize for user engagement, coherence, and diversity based on past conversation logs and pre-trained reward models.\n\n\n== Statistical comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms ==\nEfficient comparison of RL algorithms is essential for research, deployment and monitoring of RL systems. To compare different algorithms on a given environment, an agent can be trained for each algorithm. Since the performance is sensitive to implementation details, all algorithms should be implemented as closely as possible to each other. After the training is finished, the agents can be run on a sample of test episodes, and their scores (returns) can be compared. Since episodes are typically assumed to be i.i.d, standard statistical tools can be used for hypothesis testing, such as T-test and permutation test. This requires to accumulate all the rewards within an episode into a single number\u2014the episodic return. However, this causes a loss of information, as different time-steps are averaged together, possibly with different levels of noise. Whenever the noise level varies across the episode, the statistical power can be improved significantly, by weighting the rewards according to their estimated noise.\n\n\n== Challenges and Limitations ==\nDespite significant advancements, reinforcement learning (RL) continues to face several challenges and limitations that hinder its widespread application in real-world scenarios.\n\n\n=== Sample Inefficiency ===\nRL algorithms often require a large number of interactions with the environment to learn effective policies, leading to high computational costs and time-intensive to train the agent. For instance, OpenAI's Dota-playing bot utilized thousands of years of simulated gameplay to achieve human-level performance. Techniques like experience replay and curriculum learning have been proposed to deprive sample inefficiency, but these techniques add more complexity and are not always sufficient for real-world applications.\n\n\n=== Stability and Convergence Issues ===\nTraining RL models, particularly for deep neural network-based models, can be unstable and prone to divergence. A small change in the policy or environment can lead to extreme fluctuations in performance, making it difficult to achieve consistent results. This instability is further enhanced in the case of the continuous or high-dimensional action space, where the learning step becomes more complex and less predictable.\n\n\n=== Generalization and Transferability ===\nThe RL agents trained in specific environments often struggle to generalize their learned policies to new, unseen scenarios. This is the major setback preventing the application of RL to dynamic real-world environments where adaptability is crucial. The challenge is to develop such algorithms that can transfer knowledge across tasks and environments without extensive retraining.\n\n\n=== Bias and Reward Function Issues ===\nDesigning appropriate reward functions is critical in RL because poorly designed reward functions can lead to unintended behaviors. In addition, RL systems trained on biased data may perpetuate existing biases and lead to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. Both of these issues requires careful consideration of reward structures and data sources to ensure fairness and desired behaviors.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 43242, "end_char_idx": 48280, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "167a9955-3947-4612-9937-38045543aefd": {"__data__": {"id_": "167a9955-3947-4612-9937-38045543aefd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66294", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04f08270be8f71285ee7b5b465bf6d72c02f01a98d4e3b58d7be5b1d3f9b1a1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7138712e-f889-4238-a82e-826d47b964d7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3620e17788d9ff18082d64fa203589f48d6442c58971a0ce100e83a99dcce0d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Generalization and Transferability ===\nThe RL agents trained in specific environments often struggle to generalize their learned policies to new, unseen scenarios.
